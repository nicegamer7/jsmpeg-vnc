##

#### Mouse Cursor
The hosts cursor position is now drawn client sided. The cursor position (and display number) is sent each frame in the first 12 bytes of the message.

##

#### Latest JSMpeg
This fork uses the latest JSMpeg used with some additions found [here](https://github.com/nicegamer7/jsmpeg/commit/46c90240ae52238151ee0033cec1b60602e6f473).

##

#### Linux Support
Linux support has been added!

##

#### Socket Authentication:
`-password secret` would require `?password=secret` appended to the URL. If the password does not match the socket connection is closed. Unsure how secure this is, so depend on at your own risk.

##

#### Message Server:
I encountered a issue where when a lot of messages were being sent the image quality would reduce. 
To solve this another socket is opened on the next port (port + 1). If external access is needed remember to port forward both streaming and message ports (8080 and 8081 if using default ports).

In addition to above, all incoming messages are now serviced on a separate thread which may improve streaming.
##

#### Display Changing:
Support has been added to change displays client sided. Append `?display=50` to the URL to switch to display number 50.

For example another display can be created using X virtual framebuffer. You'll also likely also want to spawn a desktop enviroment, this can be done the same way VNC servers do it with `~/.vnc/xstartup` file.

Example xstartup for xfce4:
```
#!/bin/sh

unset SESSION_MANAGER
unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS

xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
xsetroot -solid grey
exec dbus-launch startxfce4
```

Example to create another display with a desktop environment:
```
Xvfb: 50 &
DISPLAY=:50 ./xstartup &
```

##

#### Shared Clipboard:
Clipboard is shared when `ctrl + c` or `ctrl + v` is pressed. If on Linux `xclip` must be installed: `sudo apt-get install xclip`.

##

#### File Uploading:
Drag-drop a file onto the player to upload to the servers `Downloads/` directory. While uploading is in progress, no input will be sent as the socket likely has a lot of data queued.

##

#### Encoder Options:

I've added group of pictures `-gop` and video buffer size `-video_buffer_size` as command line options:
 - Higher the group of pictures seems to improve quality but increases latency. 
 - Video buffer size is the maximum size a frame can be. This might need to be increased for very high bitrates. This also sets JSMpeg's `videoBufferSize` browser sided.
 
##

#### Desktop Duplication:

On Windows a desktop duplication binary exists. This utilizes the desktop duplication api which massively increases the speed of capturing the screen. Requires at least Windows 8.
